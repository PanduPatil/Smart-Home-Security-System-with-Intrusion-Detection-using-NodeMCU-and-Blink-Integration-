# Smart-Home-Security-System-with-Intrusion-Detection-using-NodeMCU-and-Blink-Integration-
Welcome to my innovative Smart Home Security System project designed to enhance home safety using NodeMCU, PIR sensors, and the power of Blink integration! 🛡️💡

Overview:

This project focuses on creating a comprehensive theft detection system for residential spaces. Leveraging the NodeMCU board, the system employs PIR (Passive Infrared) sensors strategically positioned to cover both the front and rear areas of your home. 📡🚪

Key Features:

Dual Sensor Setup: Two PIR sensors placed at strategic locations to ensure complete coverage and accurate intrusion detection.

Buzzer and LED Indicators: Instant notification of movement through both audible alerts and visual cues using LEDs.

Remote Control: The system is equipped with buttons for remote control, allowing users to toggle sensors, buzzer, and LEDs on or off as needed.

Blink App Integration: Seamlessly integrated with the Blink application for real-time notifications, keeping you informed about any potential intrusions even when you're away. 📱💬

Usage:

🚨 Activate or deactivate specific sensors remotely.

💡 Control the buzzer and LED indicators as needed.

📱 Receive instant notifications via the Blink app for any detected movements.

By open-sourcing this project on GitHub, I aim to share this effective and user-friendly home security solution with the community. Feel free to explore, contribute, and enhance the project to make homes safer for everyone! 🌐👨‍💻
